# About Me
## My Interests 
* Hobbies & Interests:
    1. I love to **read**! My most recent favorites series is called "The Raven Cycle" by Maggi Stiefvater 
    2. I love to **cook** (I make great pasta) and bake (especially banana bread!)
    3. I'm interested in pursuing a degree in engineering and perhaps a minor in philosphy or psychology 
    4. I'm aiming to go to either NC State or UNC for my undergrad!
## Websites I Recommend 
* [Wordhippo](https://www.wordhippo.com/) - As someone who loves to write, this website is great for finding synonyms for words. 
* [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) - Notion is great for building an expandable, organized workspace that you can use for personal use, or like me, for organizing things for other things you are involved in! I designed multiple workspaces for the non-profits I'm involved in
